# Welcome

This site hosts documentation for the Scania NE DevOps Team, as well as the status for [CI Monitor](/ci-monitor).

- The [CI Monitor](/ci-monitor) section covers information about [CI Monitor](https://ci-monitor.scania.com/), which is a tool for visualizing the status of our [Jenkins server](http://jenkins-ne.scania.com:8080/) and its jobs.
- The [DevOps Team](/devops-team) section contains information which is more or less internal to our team, such as information about our sprints and their goals.
